# 🌸 Bloom of Chaotic Creativity

A soft, personal archive of my design experiments and cozy digital creations.

## 🌼 What’s inside:

- ☕ 4-slide pastel drink presentation (Canva)
- 📋 Aesthetic to-do list layout
- 🐣 4 animated GIFs of cozy creatures for my JavaScript-based virtual pet project
- 🔐 Minimal login page design
- ✨ Sticker design inspired by soft chaos

This space grows with me — with every pixel, pastel, and petal I place.
